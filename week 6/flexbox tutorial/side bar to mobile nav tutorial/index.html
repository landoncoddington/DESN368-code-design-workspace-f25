  Design Concept">
        <p>Responsive web design is an approach to web development that creates dynamic changes to the
          appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view
          it.</p>
        <p>Rather than designing separate websites for different devices, responsive design uses
          flexible layouts, images, and cascading style sheet media queries to adapt content to any screen.</p>
        <p>This approach has become essential as users access websites from smartphones, tablets,
          laptops, and desktop computers with varying screen sizes.</p>

      <section id="principles">
        <img src="https://placehold.co/700x350/764ba2/white?text=Fluid+Grids+%26+Flexible+Media" alt="Fluid Grids">
        <p>Responsive web design is built on three fundamental principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fluid Grids:</strong> Using relative units like percentages instead of fixed
            pixels allows layouts to adapt proportionally to different screen sizes.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexible Images:</strong> Images and media should scale within their containing
            elements to prevent overflow and maintain layout integrity.</li>
          <li><strong>Media Queries:</strong> CSS media queries allow you to apply different styles
            based on device characteristics like screen width, height, and orientation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Together, these principles enable a single codebase to provide optimal viewing experiences
          across all devices.</p>

      <section id="layouts">
        <h2>Flexible Layouts</h2>
        <img src="https://placehold.co/750x400/3498db/white?text=Flexbox+%26+Grid+Layouts" alt="Flexible
   Layouts">
        <p>Creating flexible layouts is the foundation of responsive design. Modern CSS provides
          powerful tools for building adaptable layouts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flexbox:</strong> One-dimensional layouts that can easily reorganize content
            horizontally or vertically.</li>
          <li><strong>CSS Grid:</strong> Two-dimensional layouts perfect for complex page
            structures.</li>
          <li><strong>Relative Units:</strong> Using em, rem, vh, vw, and percentages instead of fixed
            pixel values.</li>
          <li><strong>Container Queries:</strong> Newer technique allowing components to respond to
            their container size rather than viewport.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The key is designing layouts that can gracefully adapt as screen space increases or
          decreases.</p>

      <section id="images">
        <h2>Responsive Images</h2>
        <img src="https://placehold.co/800x450/e74c3c/white?text=Image+Optimization" alt="Responsive
  Images">
        <p>Images are often the largest assets on web pages, making them critical to optimize for
          different devices and screen sizes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Srcset Attribute:</strong> Allows browsers to choose appropriate image resolution
            based on device pixel density and viewport size.</li>
          <li><strong>Picture Element:</strong> Provides full control over which image source loads
            based on media queries.</li>
          <li><strong>Image Formats:</strong> Modern formats like WebP and AVIF offer better compression
            than traditional JPEG and PNG.</li>
          <li><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> Defer loading of off-screen images until needed to improve
            initial page load performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Proper image optimization can dramatically improve page load times, especially on mobile
          networks.</p>

      <section id="media-queries">
        <h2>Media Queries</h2>
        <img src="https://placehold.co/720x380/9b59b6/white?text=Breakpoints+%26+Media+Queries" alt="Media Queries">
        <p>Media queries are the cornerstone of responsive design, allowing you to apply CSS rules based
          on device characteristics.</p>
        <p><strong>Common Breakpoints:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mobile: 0-768px</li>
          <li>Tablet: 768px-1024px</li>
          <li>Desktop: 1024px and above</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, breakpoints should be determined by your content and design needs, not just standard
          device sizes. Let your content guide where breakpoints are needed.</p>
        <p><strong>Mobile-First vs Desktop-First:</strong> Mobile-first design starts with mobile styles
          and adds complexity for larger screens, while desktop-first does the opposite. Mobile-first is
          generally recommended for better performance and progressive enhancement.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="patterns">
        <h2>Common Responsive Patterns</h2>
        <img src="https://placehold.co/780x400/27ae60/white?text=Design+Patterns" alt="Responsive
  Patterns">
        <p>Several design patterns have emerged as best practices for responsive layouts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Column Drop:</strong> Multi-column layouts that stack vertically on smaller
            screens.</li>
          <li><strong>Mostly Fluid:</strong> Grid-based layout that becomes more fluid as screen size
            increases.</li>
          <li><strong>Layout Shifter:</strong> Most adaptive pattern where layout changes significantly
            across breakpoints.</li>
          <li><strong>Off Canvas:</strong> Navigation or secondary content hidden off-screen on mobile,
            revealed via menu button.</li>
          <li><strong>Tiny Tweaks:</strong> Small adjustments to font sizes, padding, and spacing rather
            than major layout changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The pattern you choose depends on your content structure and user needs. Navigation patterns,
          in particular, require careful consideration for mobile usability.</p>
